### Hello-World Demo
- Volumetric clouds (Not used in the latest version due to fps issues)
- Falling movement
- Movement of the umbrella with the keyboard

### ForskarFredag
- Material for the first version of the landscape; Material: grass and dirt textures for lower parts of the landscape blended according to slope and snow texture for on higher parts
- Hiding the edges of the landscape by making changes to skybox and adding fog
- Added few more different volumetric clouds (Not used in the latest version due to fps issues)
- Implementation of item pickup, increasing the points the user has and showing it on HUD
- Random pickup item creation
- Added the starting room (removed in the last version)
- Mapping the phone rotation to ingame umbrella rotation (Umbrella was really shaky, removed in the latest version)

### Mission IX
- Implementation of the bombs, reducing the health of the player when hit and random movement for the bombs
- Partly implementation of the rings; (just the check if player went through the ring
- Implementation of switches between different levels. Eg. loading next level if the target is hit or loading game over level if not.
- Helped with the implementation of the controls; mapping the phone to ingame character movement
